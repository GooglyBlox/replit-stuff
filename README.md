Bunch of replit gibberish I've made in whatever language I made them in. Feel free to fork (or don't).

### [Testflight Link Scraper](https://replit.com/@GooglyBlox/Testflight-Scraper)
Scrapes [this repo](https://github.com/pluwen/awesome-testflight-link) for valid Testflight links and both prints them and writes to file. Does the repo already show which are valid? Yes. Do I prefer checking it my own way? Also yes.

### [Github Visits](https://replit.com/@GooglyBlox/Github-Visits)
Only really useful for anyone that uses arturio.dev for displaying profile visits on their page.
